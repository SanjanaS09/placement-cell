        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          The placement unit at UMIT will not compel students to accept any job offer, nor will it recommend any particular student to the industry. The process is purely voluntary, serving as a bridge between job aspirants and prospective employers.

          Any student securing an off-campus job or receiving a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) must report it to the placement office within one working day. Breaching this rule may result in disqualification from the placement process.

          Students must attend Pre-Placement Talks (PPTs) for company insights. Resumes should only be submitted through official channels. Once a job offer is secured, the student is ineligible for further interviews.
